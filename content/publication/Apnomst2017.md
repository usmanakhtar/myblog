abstract = "In this paper, we have evaluated the effectiveness of scheduling strategies in Linked Open Data based application for keeping local data caches up-to-date. We argue that the healthcare organizations are publishing data publicly, but consuming of data is difficult due to the rapid growth of the linkeddata cloud. Most of the applications that are consuming linked data suffer from challenges such as change estimation and accuracy of the index for keeping the data fresh for visualization. In this work, we have evaluated the quality of the data updates performed by the scheduling strategies. We have implemented the state-of-the-art web scheduling approaches; ChangeRatio and ChangeRate on linked dataset. We have concluded our evaluation that the strategies based on ChangeRate performed better than the ChangeRatio."

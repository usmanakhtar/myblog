abstract = " In  this  paper,  we  have  proposed  a  framework  to handle the Semantic question answering (SQA) over the Linked Open Data (LOD), where data in the form of the RDF data cube.As statistical data published all over the internet there is a need to empowers the non-expert to query in the form of the natural language.Our  proposed  framework  will  provide  a  support  to interact  in  the  form  of  the  question  answering  and  produce  a SPARQL query to extract the answer from the RDF data cube.

abstract = "In this paper, we have discussed the challenges in handling real-time medical big data collection and storage in health information system (HIS). Based on challenges, we have proposed a model for real-time analysis of medical big data. We exemplify the approach through Spark Streaming and Apache Kafka using the processing of health big data Stream. Apache Kafka works very well in transporting data among different systems such as relational databases, Apache Hadoop and non-relational databases. However, Apache Kafka lacks analyzing the stream, Spark Streaming framework has the capability to perform some operations on the stream. We have identified the challenges in current real-time systems and proposed our solution to cope with the medical big data streams."
